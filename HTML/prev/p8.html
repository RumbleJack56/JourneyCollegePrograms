    Introduction
</h1>
<pre>
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who 
employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil
rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to him in South Africa in
1914, is now used throughout the world.

Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 
22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 
to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here that Gandhi raised a family and 
first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising 
peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.

Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, 
building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule. Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven 
with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat 
simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common 
Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the 
British to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India.


Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a 
separate homeland for Muslims within British India. In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned 
into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their 
new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Abstaining from the official celebration of independence, Gandhi 
visited the affected areas, attempting to alleviate distress. In the months following, he undertook several hunger strikes to stop the 
religious violence. The last of these was begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948 when he was 78. The belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his 
defense of both Pakistan and Indian Muslims spread among some Hindus in India. Among these was Nathuram Godse, a militant Hindu nationalist 
from Pune, western India, who assassinated Gandhi by firing three bullets into his chest at an interfaith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 
1948. Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of 
Nonviolence. Gandhi is considered to be the Father of the Nation in post-colonial India.

    Early Life and Background
</h1>
<pre>
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a 
coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj. His 
father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state. His family originated from the then 
village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State.


Although he only had an elementary education and had previously been a clerk in the state administration, Karamchand proved a capable chief 
minister. During his tenure, he married four times. His first two wives died young, after each had given birth to a daughter, and his third 
marriage was childless. In 1857, he sought his third wife's permission to remarry; that year, he married Putlibai (1844–1891), who also came 
from Junagadh,[12] and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family. Karamchand and Putlibai had three children over the ensuing decade: a son, Laxmidas 
(c. 1860–1914); a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960); and another son, Karsandas (c. 1866–1913).

On 2 October 1869, Putlibai gave birth to her last child, Mohandas, in a dark, windowless ground-floor room of the Gandhi family residence in 
Porbandar city. As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as "restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about. One of his 
favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears." The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact 
on Gandhi in his childhood. In his autobiography, he states that they left an indelible impression on his mind. He writes: "It haunted me and I 
must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number." Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is 
traceable to these epic characters.

    Life in London
</h1>
<pre>
Gandhi had dropped out of the cheapest college he could afford in Bombay. Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised 
Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London. In July 1888, his wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving son, 
Harilal. His mother was not comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family, and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also 
tried to dissuade his nephew. Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would 
abstain from meat, alcohol and women. Gandhi's brother Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to 
support him. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing.

In April 1893, Gandhi aged 23, set sail for South Africa to be the lawyer for Abdullah's cousin. He spent 21 years in South Africa, 
where he developed his political views, ethics and politics.

Immediately upon arriving in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination because of his skin colour and heritage. He was not allowed to sit with  
European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a 
gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. He 
sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights.He chose to protest and was 
allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he 
refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath 
onto the street without warning.    
When Gandhi arrived in South Africa, according to Herman, he thought of himself as "a Briton first, and an Indian second". However, the 
prejudice against him and his fellow Indians from British people that Gandhi experienced and observed deeply bothered him. He found it 
humiliating, struggling to understand how some people can feel honour or superiority or pleasure in such inhumane practices. Gandhi began to 
question his people's standing in the British Empire.
    
The Abdullah case that had brought him to South Africa concluded in May 1894, and the Indian community organised a farewell party for Gandhi as 
he prepared to return to India. However, a new Natal government discriminatory proposal led to Gandhi extending his original period of stay in 
South Africa. He planned to assist Indians in opposing a bill to deny them the right to vote, a right then proposed to be an exclusive European 
right. He asked Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary, to reconsider his position on this bill. Though unable to halt the bill's 
passage, his campaign was successful in drawing attention to the grievances of Indians in South Africa. He helped found the Natal Indian 
Congress in 1894, and through this organisation, he moulded the Indian community of South Africa into a unified political force. In January 
1897, when Gandhi landed in Durban, a mob of white settlers attacked him[59] and he escaped only through the efforts of the wife of the police 
superintendent. However, he refused to press charges against any member of the mob.[46]
